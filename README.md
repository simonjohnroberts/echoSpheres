===========

Experimental sound app for Android built with Processing.

Caveats:

This is an old 'work in progress' project, put together by simonjohnrobertz@gmail in order to test drive Android Processing (http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android) specifically Rikard's neat apwidgets lib (http://code.google.com/p/apwidgets/wiki/APMediaPlayer_example). You'll need Processing (http://processing.org/) or Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/) to edit. You can run it on your Android device (only tested on an ancient HTC running 2.2.2, sorry) once you have exported and built with Ant etc. Anyway, it's just a fun little experiment, enjoy.
